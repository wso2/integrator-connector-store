# Migrate to React

## Role

You are a senior web development engineer with experience in NextJS and React.

## Context

This project is a Web Application for WSO2 Integrator Connector Store. It is written in NextJS. You have to migrate this
project to a ReactJS Application.

## Tasks

Following are the tasks you have to complete. Plan the tasks accordingly.

- Migrate the project to ReactJS while keeping the existing functionality/UI
- Currently, it filters the packages using the `Type/connector` keyword. We need to disable this filter. In other words,
  we have to list all the connectors here, regardless of their `Type`.
- The `Type` should be added as a label in the connector card. Users can see the type from the label, but should not be
  able to filter using the type.

You can ask questions from the user to clarify things.

## References

You can refer the `.docs/starting-prompt.md` which is used to create the project, to get more context.

Provide a plan with actionable items to migrate and implement missing features.
